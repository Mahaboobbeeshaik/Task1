<h2>Html       <img src="https://up.yimg.com/ib/th?id=OIP.HCn9NkA9Oxf9wWol4u_QjgHaE8&pid=Api&rs=1&c=1&qlt=95&w=158&h=105" height="30px"></h2>
<p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create web pages. It provides the basic structure of a site, which is then enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose or wrap different parts of the content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The enclosed content could be a text, an image, or a video</p>
<h2>CSS        <img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tAvAD5lCtDJSjywplxd37QHaEo&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" height="30px"></h2>
<p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements on a web page should be displayed, including their layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance. This separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS) is a key aspect of web development, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the look and feel of a website.

One of the primary benefits of CSS is its ability to apply styles consistently across multiple pages of a website. By linking a single CSS file to multiple HTML documents, you can ensure a uniform appearance throughout the site and make global changes to the design quickly and efficiently. For instance, if you want to change the font style or color scheme, you only need to update the CSS file once, and the changes will be reflected across the entire site.</p>

<p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language that is primarily used to create dynamic and interactive content on websites. Unlike HTML, which structures web content, and CSS, which styles it, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages, allowing for more engaging user experiences.

One of the key strengths of JavaScript is its ability to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the structure of a web page. JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to update content, handle user input, and respond to events like clicks and form submissions. This interactivity is essential for creating responsive web applications that can adapt to user actions without needing to reload the page.</p>

<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular languages in the world, widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and many other fields.</p>
